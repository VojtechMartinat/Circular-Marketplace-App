## Project Overview

This project aims to transform second-hand marketplaces by harnessing the power of AI to deliver an unparalleled user experience. As part of this initiative, you will develop a dedicated robust app for Android and iOS, enabling users to effortlessly add items they no longer use to the platform. Unlike existing platforms, our vision includes an integrated minimal chatbot that simplifies uploading photos and describing items. Whether a user prefers typing or voice control, the app shall ensure a streamlined, quick and user-friendly experience. Additionally, AI shall be used to classify and tag uploaded photos for precise and efficient searches later by other users, perfectly matching users with the items they seek. Join us in creating a circular marketplace platform that sets new standards for simplicity and efficiency, contributing to reducing waste and fostering greater sharing.
